Dictionary game
Brief explanation of working prototype

After clicking the start button random word is generated by the library - random-words (has local list of words).
Then the word is passed to the dictionary API request and the result is displayed in div. All words but those in the list of manually generated pronouns are clickable.
The first word is saved in React state, and all subsequent words are saved in state as an array. This is to show all steps taken throughout the game.
In case if any subsequent word in the chain coincides with the first word from which the game started, the game ends with the player/user winning and congratulating bar appears on the screen. 
But since it is very difficult to win the game, reaching the first searchable word, I artificially hardcoded the winning on the fourth step by assigning the first word to one of the words received from API response. This is done for demonstrating the final step and can be redone anytime.
There are Next / Previous buttons for navigation, and, also it is possible to navigate any step from the chain of words by clicking on the words themselves.
This is achieved by saving incoming word descriptions from dictionary API in array of React state, thus avoiding repeated requests.





This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
